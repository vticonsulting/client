And then Billie said \"Yeah, we have two mommies, one here, and one at our house (referring to foster family)\". </p><p>Tesla is looking forward to meeting everyone this Sunday at 4:30pm at Jones Bridge Park.  It's amazing that all of us are able to attend! This really is the dream team.  I was thinking of just bringing Covid-friendly snacks and drinks Sunday (think cheese sticks, applesauce, prepackaged trail mix, and some little waters and juice boxes)...anyone one bring something?</p><p>Also, Nevaeh's birthday is September 3rd!  So soon! Is anyone up for helping Tesla plan a birthday celebration for her oldest?  She  may actually have some help from foster mom as well as her mentor, Robin.  Who, according to Billie, just had a baby.  (I'm telling you, she's a wealth of information).  So I'm not sure if she needs our help or not, but is anyone available to take the reins on that?</p><p>I think that is it for now!</p><p><br></p><p>Looking forward to seeing you all at Jones Bridge Park at 4:30.  I will get there early and send a text about where we end up (obviously away from the crowds).</p><p><br></p><p>All the best,</p><p>Stefanie</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

    "text_update": "<p><span xss=removed>Hello Dream Team!</span></p><p>I hope you all are doing well!  I loved that we got to all be together with Tesla a couple of weeks ago.  What a special time.  She has been nothing but grateful for our team.</p><p><br></p><p>She recently found out that she doesn't qualify for Food stamps (she makes $30/month too much).  But she still needs help with food.  So we will continue to help supplement 2x month, and I am looking for other resources for her (like Northlands Food Pantry).</p><p><br></p><p>We have a 5th Wednesday in September.  Is anyone able and willing to sign up for another meal?  If so, please sign up below.</p><p><br></p><p>And I think I've finally figured out how you can sign up to bring Tesla groceries.  The next date for groceries is next Tuesday, September 22nd.  Sign ups are attached to this email.</p><p><br></p><p>Curious to know how to do the groceries? </p><p>I have taken her supplemental groceries twice and here's what I did.  I went to pick up the free produce arranged by Promises 686.  (I picked it up from the red truck that is parked at Perimeter church).  They have all kinds of things: broccoli, celery, romaine lettuce, green apples, onion, white potatoes, sweet potatoes, zucchini, tomatoes, bananas etc.  I got enough for their family of three, and then also picked up a few other things from Trader Joes: some chicken, spaghetti sauce, noodles, spices, healthy salad dressing, olive oil and a few other things I can't remember.  The idea is to help her come up with a meal plan.  So with the groceries, I wrote a recipe for her to make some seasoned chicken and roast veggies with what I picked up.  Just trying to take the guess work out of it for her, and give her an idea. I don't think I spent more than $30 (and some of the stuff will last longer than a week, like the olive oil and dressing).</p><p><br></p><p>Here are some ideas from Johnna (Promise686):</p><p>Each volunteer will provide this two times during the 5-6 months of serving. Please check with the caregiver to the preferences of various foods. This is supplementary not a full week’s worth of groceries. Ideally, providing groceries on the second and fourth weeks when finances might be strained at the end of pay periods. Fresh produce, dairy and healthy snacks could be great supplements. Call the caregiver before you shop so you can provide what is most needed. Ideally no more than $75 is spent on these groceries. Another great idea is to shop for a simple recipe (spaghetti casserole), give the caregiver the recipe when you deliver the groceries and offer to walk her through it when she’s ready to prepare it (can easily be done by phone). This will teach the caregiver know how to plan a meal, shop for it and make it. If the recipe can be doubled, that can also be a great relief not to have to prepare a meal every night. Again, you can claim these grocery needs on the calendar on Promise Serves. </p><p>Fresh Free Produce through Promise686: </p><p>Promise686 receives free produce each Tuesday at the office usually around 10-11 AM. The red truck is later in the afternoon parked at Perimeter Church parking lot and you have permission to take what you need to serve your family. Each week the offerings vary, but commonly you can choose from apples, oranges, bananas, potatoes, sweet potatoes, onions and carrots. Often there is lettuce, other fruits, bagels, bread, etc… Bring a bag or box with you to load up. If you cannot pick groceries at Perimeter, you can send a text message to Erin Adams at Promise686 on Monday of your week at to reserve a box for you to pick up that Tuesday. Her number is 770-356-0470. The P686 office is 1900 Holcomb Bridge Rd, Norcross, GA 30071.</p><p><br></p><p>Please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions!!!</p><p><br></p><p>All the best,</p><p>Stefanie</p>",

We have no one scheduled to bring a meal this week, but they will not be available Wednesday evening.  Malachi is their 5-month old second foster child and she said that she has gathered all the supplies she needs for him and he is doing much better (as you can imagine this applies significantly to sleeping..ha ha).  Tavy's surgery is coming up 12/1/20 in Indianapolis to have his tonsils and adenoids removed.  I would appreciate prayers for everyone so his surgery is successful so they can be back in time for Kylie's birthday on 12/3!  Mandy did say that if Tavy has to stay in Indianapolis for an extended period, they might need help with childcare.</p><p><br></p><p>I did set up the meals in PromiseServes.org.  You should get an email reminder 5 days before and 1 day before.  There is also a way that you can go in and acknowledge that you accept the \"event\".  I would appreciate if you would do that.</p><p><br></p><p>If you would all send me your birthday, I could add them to our calendar so we can celebrate with you!</p><p><br></p><p>I am thankful that each of you are on this Care Community team!  I wish you all a very blessed Thanksgiving and hope we all spend the day counting the ways God has blessed us all!</p><p>Michelle Schymik</p>",

They had a wonderful Thanksgiving and Sienna got to see her parents on that day which is a wonderful answer to prayer.  Her parents are doing so well and continue to have unsupervised visits with Sienna. Sienna turns 1 this week and they'll be having a little birthday gathering for her. I'll be taking over cookies and a gift from our team. :)</p><p>Tony and Sara normally have all their previous foster children and their \"biofamilies\" over for a big Christmas party (amazing!) but because of Covid, they will be having the families over one at time.( still amazing )  The busy planning that goes into this will make them extra thankful for their Thursday evening meals.  :) </p><p>Gabe finally has an appointment with the school district for his assessments. And the Regional Center just did theirs and have recommended hours of therapy through their center. Another answer to prayer. :)  Every time I spend time with them, Gabe is communicating better. :)</p><p>Thank you all for showing Jesus' love to Sara and Tony.   Let's pray that they will come to church.  Also, pray that they will be able to go to one of our Christmas services and/or the Children's Christmas play.     I know we are mostly praying for their hearts to be open to the gospel.   I believe the Holy Spirit is working. </p><p>God Bless you ladies!</p><p>Barb</p>",

I never thought I could speak in front of kids without some form of panic.</p><p>I tell you this because I know how serving transforms faith. It grows it deeper, wider, and higher. With that being said, this also means the devil will try to stop our growth. So I want each of you to know, I am here for you for prayer. Any prayer request you give me will be kept in confidence unless you say it is for the group. Then I will forward to the group. Anything said in the group, stays in the group.</p><p>My contact information is:</p><p>(715)207-9095</p><p>keasland@yahoo.com </p><p>This week let us pray for the Millers to have a great Christmas season, full of great memories. </p><p>My goals this week are to talk to Carrisa and paint what delivering meals looks like.
